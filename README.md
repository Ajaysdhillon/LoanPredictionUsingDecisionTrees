README: Loan Approval Prediction using Decision Tree
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies Machine Learning (Decision Tree Classification) to predict loan approval based on applicant details. It demonstrates:
âœ… Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
âœ… Feature selection & model training
âœ… Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
âœ… Visualization of Decision Tree

This project strengthens my Machine Learning portfolio for MSc applications by showcasing my ability to:
âœ” Work with real-world datasets
âœ” Apply supervised learning techniques
âœ” Interpret model outputs and optimize performance

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)

Machine Learning (Decision Tree Classifier)

Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, Label Encoding)

ðŸ“Š Results & Insights
The model predicts loan approval with reasonable accuracy.

The decision tree visualization provides explainability in loan approval decisions.

Potential improvements include hyperparameter tuning and testing with more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
